## Motivation

Starting from a personal interest of technology itself, over a few months, I have already compiled a large collection of vintage items. Those range from old rotary telephones, mechanical typewriters and mechanical calculators over to electronic retro technology such as a KAYPRO II, various HIGHSCREEN devices and Commodore computers.

With this in mind, I and a few buddies of mine thought to ourselves that maybe we could start to build our very own version of an *old* computer like those mentioned above from scratch; the machine as well as the operating system.
